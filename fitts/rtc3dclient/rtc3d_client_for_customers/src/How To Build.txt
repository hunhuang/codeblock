Real Time C3D client containing the same version of the protocol as found in First Principles. This client comes with the source code.
This client comes as is. Feel free to use it to speed up your plugin development. This client does't contain XML parser.

Programmers Note: 
The dll is build with the  Multithreaded DLL compiler option. If your application is using a different setting you may
run into run-time errors caused by different memory heaps. You will run into problems if you let the client to allocate memory 
( add 3d or tool items ) in the GetLatest3d( vector<Position3d> & vLatest3d ) member function and try to deallocate 
it in your application using a different heap. The workaround is to make sure the vLatest3d vector contains enough items. You are free to use
client sample code and use it in your plugin.
